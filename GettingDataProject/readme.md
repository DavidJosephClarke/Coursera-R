**My Coursera Project**

Welcome to my Coursera project! The "run_analysis.R" script is designed to create a file called tidydata.csv from the data provided to us in our course. In order to run this program, the dataset https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip must be downloaded and unzipped into a directory called UCI HAR Dataset directly under the working directory. Additionally, the package dplyr must been installed, as well.

The actual data content has not been altered. Information from both training and testing data set have been combined, along with activity information, and the mean and standard deviation have been extracted. Column names have been renamed for clarity purposes. The script is commented to describe each step of the process, and there is a codebook (codebook.R) which gives further details on the data and variables.

Thank you!
